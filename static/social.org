What is the currency of life?

My blog post on [[https://www.haiverin.scot/arts/currency-of-life/][haiverin.scot]] tries to answer that question.

Expect to read about art, drawing, and the true measure of love.

A little history of Swatch Internet Time? Maybe even some Emacs time converter tools just for funsies?

My blog post about [[https://www.haiverin.scot/tech/beat-time/][.beat time]] on [[https://www.haiverin.scot][haiverin.scot]] might be what you need if you found either of the above intriguing.

If not... quite right: I'm not in charge of you.

After many requests from people on Reddit, I wrote an insanely long blog post about restoring an Olivetti Lettera 22 typewriter. I think you'd need to be pretty into typewriters to get anything out of this one.

All the same, if you think that sounds good then head over to [[https://www.haiverin.scot/arts/a-typewriters-next-chapter/][the blog post]] and see for yourself.

I wrote a short treatise on the virtues of trying new things, with the conclusion being that the more things we try, the easier it will be to assimilate new skills and have greater success in life as a unique generalist.

If that sounds interesting to you, have a read of [[https://www.haiverin.scot/life/shooting-for-suck-cess/][Shooting For Suck-cess]] over at [[https://www.haiverin.scot][haiverin.scot]].

# Instructions

- [x] Encourage engagement and interaction
- [x] Keep all blog entries as leaf bundles (for example, `hugo new content tech/blog-entry-name` with no .md creates a leaf bundle in the tech section)
- [x] Create a banner image (post-cover.png) in your leaf bundle that has a ratio of 1.85:1, and is no smaller than: 962x520 pixels (Ideally 1536x830 or greater)
- [x] Still manually add banner image into page content, first thing before anything else using the banner shortcode
- [x] Add any other images you use to the images front matter array (this is purely to help with OpenGraph generation)
- [x] You can use up to two more images in the blog entry, but try not to use any more (unless this is a listicle). Only the banner is essential
- [x] Try to write 1000 words. The closer to this number, the better, but don't go over (75% of the public prefers reading articles under 1,000 words)
- [x] Reading time should not exceed seven minutes
- [x] Make sure to include a description and summary for the blog entry as these are used on the site and in SEO
- [x] Make an appropriate choice of tags in the front matter. These will help in recommending pages to the reader
- [x] Make an appropriate choice of categories in the front matter. The first category will be used in the breadcrumb for the page, others will generate the side menu
- [x] Use Emacs to generate the reading ease and grade level (this should happen automatically when saving the file in my Emacs configuration). These are just for fun, incidentally, and appear to have no impact on audience engagement
- [x] Set the draft to false when you want to publish, then push to GitHub
- [ ] Drop a video announcing this post on Instagram etc, and post anywhere else you can as well. Reels and videos work better for engagement
- [ ] Consider what tomorrow's article will be, and try to post a new one once a day (more is fine)

My father gave me a valuable gift when I was a child, and I wanted to share it with you all.

Dad had a degree in engineering, was the son of an engineer, and ran an engineering company. So, when something needed fixing around the house, Dad always did it himself. But as soon as I was old enough to point a flashlight, he would have me help him.

While merely being included at such a young age gave me a sense of achievement, my Dad also took the time to explain what he was doing with his repairs. As my strength and competance grew, he'd have me do more things to help. It was simple things at first---like screwing pieces together---but with each new duty, he'd impart more knowledge from his own experiences.

Do you know how to drive screws in the correct order to prevent misallignment and strain-cracking? I do, because my Dad taught me.

Do you know how to open a rusted-shut lock by applying WD-40? I do, because my Dad taught me.

Do you know how to change the blade drive belt on a ride-on lawnmower's cutting deck? I do, because my Dad taught me.

I've learned more repair skills from my Dad than I can count, and all this knowledge has shown me how things work. From a young age, I could determine how something was broken, come up with solutions, and then apply them.

The reason I consider this such a valuable gift is that it made me confident about my own potential. I wasn't afraid to try things because I had a good gauge of my abilities. I believed that I could do anything, but didn't have the time to do everything.

My father hadn't just given me useful skills: ***he'd shown me that we are often more capable than we realise if we just make the effort to try***.

I've carried this lesson with me my whole life, and even more so as the years roll on. The world is so full of wonders, and our lives are so very short. It's worth trying things and learning things and having a go, even when it's outside your wheelhouse. I call this philosophy, "***Suck-cess***."

> **Suck-cess**, *noun*  
> /səkˈsɛs/   
> The achievement of succeeding in a field despite lacking formal training. "They've achieved great suck-cess: either through luck; trial-and-error; self-study; or intuition."

But here's the really interesting thing: the more things that I try, the easier new things become. I'm not really starting from scratch each time; I'm building on top of my existing skills while adding new ones. I adapt what I already have, then add in what's missing.

In this way, we can all have greater suck-cess in life as unique generalists, rather than formally trained specialists. The [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) suggests that it takes the same amount of time to learn five different skills at 80% proficiency as it would take to learn just one at 100%. I'm not knocking specialists, of course: they are a vital part of pushing humanity forward. But even a specialist would benefit from also being a generalist in other areas.

For example, I happen to have a doctorate in Computing Science. It was tremendously difficult to attain and required more concerted effort than any other venture in my life thus far. I am, by any reasonable measure, a specialist in computing. However, I also occasionally perform my own music to a generous crowd. I can do enough bookbinding to make presents for my friends and keep me stocked up on peronsonalised notebooks for the rest of my life. I can knit and sew my own clothes. I can draw pictures of my family that actually look like them. I can fix and restore vintage machinery. I know how to use and maintain fountain pens and typewriters. I've created visual effects in music videos for some of my favourite bands. I've kept a sourdough starter alive for the past five years and make bread with it every week. And I know just enough about typography to be dangerous.

All those things came about because I decided it would be fun to have a go. I didn't want to become an expert or attain a certification---I just wanted to learn enough that I could perhaps enrich my life in some meaningful way before moving on and learning another new skill. I am perhaps the only person alive who can do this very odd collection of things, and I've never felt more special.

So what am I proposing here?

I'm saying, "Have a go; try something new; and don't be content."

Let's become a world of tinkerers and experimentors. Let's push our personal limitations and really see what we're capable of.

It's been my experience that people remember your achievements more than how you achieved them. It doesn't matter than you didn't go to art school if someone likes your painting. It doesn't matter than you don't have an engineering degree if someone likes your invention. And it doesn't matter that you only started learning last year when you've already got a lifetime of skills to build upon.

We can all explore the great wide world of possibilities before us, enriching our lives with new skills and abilities. Some might be a disaster and some might be near-professional, but you won't know until you try.

Take the time to learn from others: read books; watch videos; and ask questions. There are more ways to learn than those that end with certification. It's true that none of us have the time to do everything that the universe has to offer. But perhaps, by believing that we can do anything we set our minds to, we can get a good deal closer than we ever thought possible.

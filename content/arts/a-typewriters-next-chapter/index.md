# Instructions

- [ ] Encourage engagement and interaction
- [x] Keep all blog entries as leaf bundles (for example, `hugo new content tech/blog-entry-name` with no .md creates a leaf bundle in the tech section)
- [x] Create a banner image (post-cover.png) in your leaf bundle that has a ratio of 1.85:1, and is no smaller than: 962x520 pixels (Ideally 1536x830 or greater)
- [x] Still manually add banner image into page content, first thing before anything else using the banner shortcode
- [ ] Add any other images you use to the images front matter array (this is purely to help with OpenGraph generation)
- [ ] You can use up to two more images in the blog entry, but try not to use any more (unless this is a listicle). Only the banner is essential
- [ ] Try to write 1000 words. The closer to this number, the better, but don't go over (75% of the public prefers reading articles under 1,000 words)
- [ ] Reading time should not exceed seven minutes
- [ ] Make sure to include a description and summary for the blog entry as these are used on the site and in SEO
- [ ] Make an appropriate choice of tags in the front matter. These will help in recommending pages to the reader
- [ ] Make an appropriate choice of categories in the front matter. The first category will be used in the breadcrumb for the page, others will generate the side menu
- [ ] Use Emacs to generate the reading ease and grade level (this should happen automatically when saving the file in my Emacs configuration). These are just for fun, incidentally, and appear to have no impact on audience engagement
- [ ] Set the draft to false when you want to publish, then push to GitHub
- [ ] Drop a video announcing this post on Instagram etc, and post anywhere else you can as well. Reels and videos work better for engagement
- [ ] Consider what tomorrow's article will be, and try to post a new one once a day (more is fine)

I believe this is the first time that I've publicly written about typewriters. People who only know me a little might be surprised at my interest in them, given that I have a [strong computing background](https://theses.gla.ac.uk/2760/) (including when it comes to [writing](https://github.com/sympodius/org-novelist)). However, I am a great believer in building things that will last, and I have a particular fondness for analogue creation methods. I also believe strongly in buying and maintaining well built things, rather than regularly replacing poorly made ones.

Recently, I decided to gift a typewriter to a talented author friend of mine. In order to make it as useful as possible, I wanted it to be a manual typewriter (so that no power would be needed), and for it to look and work like new. Since the production of high quality manual typewriters ended decades ago, this was no small task.

My research showed that there had been two typewriter factories near where I'd grown up: Olivetti and Remington. The Olivetti one was much closer to my childhood home (6 km as opposed to 19 km) and I felt that might make the gift more meaningful. Olivetti had plants all over the world, many producing the same models, but the most iconic typewriter to be produced (non-exclusively) at the [Olivetti Glasgow plant](https://oztypewriter.blogspot.com/2015/05/inside-olivetti-typewriter-factory.html) was most certainly the [Lettera 22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivetti_Lettera_22), so that's what I decided to go for.

Of course, the first thing I tried was to find a Glasgow made Olivetti Lettera 22 that was already in excellent condition and required not work whatsoever. But fate is rarely so generous. I also specifically wanted one with the leather strapped carrying bag, and a tabulator function. The only machine being sold at the time that satisfied all these conditions 

1. Why did you do this? What led to this? What is this? How did you select the particular typewriter, etc? what looked good about it?
2. What is this post going to show, and what is it not going to show?
3. The tutorial part 1: The Machine
   1. Assessment of Required Work
   2. Typewriter not functional. Main spring loose inside housing. Drawband frayed and likely to snap. Carriage release always on. brake pad missing. Case loose and wobbly. Paint scratches exposing some metal (potential rust risk). Case dirty. Feet worn down and not grippy. Interior of machine is gross. Carriage lock mechanism not functional. Missing ribbon spool screw (later found inside). Some letters misaligned to the point of being distracting (not discovered till later when machine first working).
   3. Case dirty, including paint and other gunk. Black flecks inside (probably degraded rubber). Internal name that I'd intended to leave, but it came off accidentally during cleaning. Internal pad coming off. Zipper disintegrated. zipper crossover covers disintegrating. Flip latch coming off and rotting, with stitches missing in most parts. Tears on hinge. Leather on handles deteriorating and coming loose. Musty smell. No other surprises from what I'd expected from photos.
   4. Ordering supplies. fishing line. rubber grommets. nail polish. new feet (where did I order these from?). cillit-bang multipurpose. Microfiber cloths. crystalline wax. Textile glue. YKK zips. Gutterman thread, leather thread. Leather, white spirit, soft wire brush
   5. Dismantled case. Bottom held on by feet screws. Top held on by four other screws (with missing spacers). Tricky removal of carriage. Discovered missing ribbon spool screw.
   6. covered keys with terry towel cloth, then used an air blower to gently get the worst blown out. Then used white spirit/mineral spirits with a soft wire brush, being particularly careful around springs, and particularly attentive around type slugs. Do both the blowing and white spirit cleaning outdoors. Allow to dry naturally (do not rinse with anything except white spirit).
   7. Dismantled carriage to get access to failing spring. Very particular spanner required. Tried to adjust to make it work, but it immediately snapped. Had a swiss army knife replacement spring to hand, and it seemed quite close. Chopped off rounded end with wire cutters, then filed the key shape with a metal file by hand. Cleaned all the non-painted parts with white spirit and wire brush, as with main body. Cleaned painted parts with cillit band, and then waxed with crystaline wax. Used rubber rejuvinator on platen. Reassembled carriage. No photos of this. Direct to wherever you learned how to do it? Did I just do it myself? I think perhaps I did.
   8. Used cillit bang to thorough clean keys on every side. You have to do this key by key to make a really good job.
   9. Remove main spring and dismantled, then rewound the spring (required repositioning the spring into the catch---the reason it was not working). Replaced frayed drawband with fishing line. Tricky work to retension after fitting. Didn't want to push the spring too hard at this point, so left it with more tension than before, but not too much.
   10. Put aside main machine for a while and looked at case. Scraped off spoiled rubber from old spacers. Cleaned case top and bottom and ribbon cover with cillit bang and microfiber cloth until clean. Spray on cloth method. Once cleaned, buffed off with clean microfiber cloth.
   11. Tried to get a close match to colour by mixing some nail polish colours. Tricky to do because of quick drying time. Test on underside of case first. Because not an exact match, smaller scratches were covered with clear nailpolish for protection, but to stop it looking like a jackson pollock painting.
   12. Waxed with a third cloth, and buffed off again with a fourth. Managed to retain all original felt, though I used a lot of cillit bang to reduce musty smell.
   13. Reattached carriage to main body for testing (not putting on tricky back bit at this stage. Fiddly to thread drawband under and over the tab mechanisms. Success-ish. Carraige release now only on when actively pressed. Mainspring now working, but not strong enough.
   14. Added more turns to spring, tested, and again, tested, and again... got to about 95% of where I needed to be and really couldn't turn it any more. Main spring then became unsprung again and I had to remove it to recoil it. On reattaching, the screw snapped.
   15. Source new mainspring. Cheaper to just buy donor machine.
   16. Nicked mainspring from donor machine. Worked great. Donor machine had no tabulator, but was already refurbushed by Olivetti, so had one of the newer style mainsprings. In all other respects, it seemed in good order.
   17. Machine now working, just left it at 95% of spring power (A4 would never use the whole line anyway).
   18. Adjusted carriage lock to hit groove to make it work.
   19. Manually carved down and filed a Champagne cork to make a brake pad. Glued on with PVC. Kind of an odd balance because it adds to the drawband problem, but feels necessary for tabulator.
   20. Reassembled body, including new feet and rubber spacers, and missing spool screw.
   21. Machine now working in full. Yay! However, some key slugs are badly misaligned. Used spark plug pliers to gently bend and adjust to correct form. Not perfect, but not distracting any more. Typewriter basically back to fully functioning and looking great. Ideally, I'd also get the platen re-surfaced, but it's working fine for the moment, and that would be a big expense.
4. The tutorial part 2: The Case (possibly a new post?)
   1. Cleaned the case exterior using cillit-bang on microfiber cloth method. Kept applying until no more good could be seen, then wiped off excess with a dry microfiber cloth. Cleaning highlighted that flap was loose, so I just pulled it off and cleaned underneath. Gunk and paint flecks were removed painstakingly by gently scratching and prying off with a sewing needle (leather much more delicate than textile in this regard). Once done, cillit-bang applied again to remove loosened flecks and such. Degraded rubber removed from interior, then cillit band used to brighten the lining. Accidentally caused writing to be removed. Glued down loose foot pad with textile glue.
   2. I then removed all stitching from separated flap that kept the two parts of the flap together, then applied a Klucel G mixture to stop further leather rot, and to help keep side together. I then did saddle stitch all the way around, using original holes only. I then attached to case by saddle stitching the `eye' shape previously used. I did just go all the way through though, as removing lining for this would have been too destructive (keeping as much of original case as possible, and only replacing things when absolutely necessary). Fittings were in good working order. Used leather conditioner before reattaching.
   3. Removed zip crossover leather (deteriotating anyway). Removed zips carefully with a seam ripper. Peeled back some of the cloth lining at hinges. I then pinned the zip in place along the length of one side (one zip each side, so this procedure had to be duplicated after first zip finished) to make sure that it would line up when zipped. Then, painstakingly saddle stitched the zip using the original holes and the gutterman thread. A little extr zip was kept (closed) and tucked under lining. Lining not glued back down yet though. Once top and bottom were attached, and zip closed fine (gradiant rise near hinge was kept a little loose to try to avoid what happened to original zip), process was repeated for second zip.
   4. With both zips in place, rear hinges were fixed. The textile material from the excess of the zips was trimmed to size and glued to cover the hidden side of tears, as well as all down the thread line. This involved clamping. Once dry, saddle stitched, keeping stitches to be hidden by internal case lining. Textile glue internal lining back on to cover end of zips and new stitching.
   5. Cut small leather strips to match those removed from zip crossovers. Japanese stuff applied, leather then rolled around to soften, and the bevelled. Leather then saddle stitch on. Holes were pre-punched using an awl to get spacing correct. Truly correct approach would have been to remove piping and sew underneath, but this seemed like too destructive an act for a very minor aesthetic improvement. They won't be seen most of the time and are really just to make the zip crossover a little less ugly because of the staples.
   6. Removed leather from metal handles with a seam ripper and butter knife (for prying). Scraped and cleaned off as much rotted leather and glue as possible to give a clean metal surface. Used the removed pieces as a templated for cutting new leather. Leather was softened with that japanese stuff, and rolled around, then edges beveled.
   7. Awl used to pre-punch holes, making sure to line up on both sides.
   8. Klucel G applied to help stick leather to metal, then put in place and saddle stitched. This involved really stretching the leather as you go, both by hand, and by tightening the thread. It must be kept super tight. Finished?
5. Musty smell was addressed by leaving open case and typewriter with ribbon cover off in the sun for a few hours, then storing with a dryer sheet in the basket with the case zipped up. This was then replaced once a week until smell was gone.
6. Summary of good feeling (what this makes you happy, and did the people like the present?).
7. Once done, go back through and add as much whimsy and entertaining writing into this as possible to make it less drab.
